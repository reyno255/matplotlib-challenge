# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

## Observations

1. The number of observants is evenly distributed between gender which means there is an good representation in the trial.

2. The correlation between mouse weight and tumor size is .89.  Which means, as the mouse weight increases, the final tumor volume observation increases less than 1x.  This could be due to an increased effectiveness of the drug Capomulin in heavier mice.

3. The Capomulin trial demonstrated a consistent reduction in final tumor size over time and did so with what appears to be a tighter distribution within the IQR.            Which suggests that the results were more uniform versus other trials.
