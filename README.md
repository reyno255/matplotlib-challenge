# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

## Observations

1. The number of observants is evenly distributed between gender

2. The correlation between mouse weight and tumor size is greater than 1.  Which means, the greater the mouse weight, the greater the tumor volume.

3. The Capomulin trial demonstrated a consistent reduction in final tumor size over time and did so with what appears to be a tighter distribution within the IQR.            Which suggests that the results were more uniform versus other trials.
